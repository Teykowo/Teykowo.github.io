This project is a attempt at an online curriculum vit√¶ using github's generous offer of hosting a custom website for free.

As both an effort to make the website look pretty and for training purposes, it uses webGL for graphic rendering.
It is thus possible that some elements work poorly or not at all on some hardware and/or software. if such a case arises, 
you may want to use a windows computer and chrome as a web browser, since these was the setup during developpement.

You can disable the starting animation by clicking the switch in the upper left corner.

You are free to use this template for non commercial ends as long as you add a link to the original github repository.
Basic knowledge of computer graphics (shaders, buffering. GLSL, openGl/webGL), and linear algebra is recommended when browsing the code base, 
but do not fret otherwise as every line is commentated upon heavily so as to be understandable by as many as possible.

A known issue is with opera, where the 3D animations tend to have a slower framerate.
