This project is an attempt at making an online curriculum vit√¶ using github's generous offer of hosting a custom website for free.

As both an effort to make the website look pretty and for training purposes, it uses webGL for graphics rendering.
It is thus possible that some elements will work poorly, or not at all, on some hardware and/or software. if such a case arises, 
you may want to use a windows computer and chrome as a web browser, since it was the setup used during developpement.

You can disable the starting animation by clicking the switch in the upper left corner.

You are free to use this template for non commercial use as long as you add a link to the original github repository.
Basic knowledge of computer graphics (shaders, buffering. GLSL, openGl/webGL), and linear algebra is recommended when browsing the code base, 
but do not fret otherwise, as every line is heavily commented so as to be understandable by as many as possible.

A known issue is with opera, where the 3D animations tend to lower the framerate.
